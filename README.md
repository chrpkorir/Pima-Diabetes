# Pima-Diabetes

This project uses Logistic Regression to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, 

based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. 

Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database.

All patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

The dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney  Diseases.
